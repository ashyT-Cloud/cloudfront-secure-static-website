# 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to securely host a static website on AWS following modern cloud security and DevOps best practices.

Instead of making the Amazon S3 bucket public, the website is served through **Amazon CloudFront** using **Origin Access Control (OAC)**. Infrastructure is provisioned using **Terraform**, while **GitHub Actions** automates validation and deployment.

This repository was built as a portfolio project to demonstrate Infrastructure as Code (IaC), CI/CD automation, AWS cloud services, and secure architecture design.

### Architecture Flow

```
User
   │
 HTTPS
   │
   ▼
Amazon CloudFront
   │
Origin Access Control (OAC)
   │
   ▼
Private Amazon S3 Bucket
```

Terraform provisions and manages the infrastructure while using:

- Amazon S3 for Remote Terraform State
- Amazon DynamoDB for State Locking

# 🔐 Security Best Practices

✔ Amazon S3 Block Public Access enabled

✔ Private S3 Bucket

✔ CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC)

✔ Infrastructure managed using Terraform

✔ Terraform Remote Backend

✔ DynamoDB State Locking

✔ IAM User for GitHub Actions Deployment

✔ GitHub Repository Secrets for AWS Credentials

---

# ⚙️ Infrastructure Provisioned

Terraform provisions the following AWS resources:

- S3 Bucket (Website)
- S3 Bucket Versioning
- Public Access Block
- Bucket Policy
- CloudFront Distribution
- Origin Access Control
- Remote State Bucket
- DynamoDB Lock Table

---

# 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

The deployment pipeline is powered by **GitHub Actions**.

## Workflow

```

GitHub Actions
     │
     ├── Checkout Repository
     ├── Terraform Format Check
     ├── Terraform Validate
     ├── Validate Website Files
     ├── Upload Website to Amazon S3
     └── CloudFront Cache Invalidation
```

---

## Amazon CloudFront

![CloudFront](docs/screenshots/cloudfront.png)

CloudFront securely delivers website content over HTTPS using Origin access Control (OAC).

---

## GitHub Actions

![GitHub Actions](docs/screenshots/github-actions.png)

The CI/CD pipeline validates Terraform, uploads the website to Amazon S3, and invalidates the Cloudfront cache automatically after every push to the main branch.

## 📊 Project Highlights

- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Secure Static Website Hosting on AWS
- Private Amazon S3 Bucket
- Amazon CloudFront with Origin Access Control (OAC)
- Remote Terraform Backend (S3 + DynamoDB)
- Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions

---

# 🧩 Key Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| AWS account verification blocked CloudFront creation | Waited for AWS account verification and resumed deployment |
| CloudFront returned Access Denied | Uploaded website content to the private S3 bucket and verified Origin Access Control (OAC) |
| Workflow file placed in the wrong directory | Moved the workflow to `.github/workflows` |
| Git commits made on the wrong branch | Reviewed the branch history and completed the release work on `main` |
| Terraform backend warning | Kept the current implementation and documented the newer `use_lockfile` approach for future enhancement |

# 📚 Learning Outcomes

This project strengthened my practical understanding of AWS cloud services, Infrastructure as Code, secure static website hosting, CI/CD automation, Git workflows, and production-inspired DevOps practices.

---

# 🔮 Future Improvements

- Route 53 Integration
- Custom Domain
- AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
- GitHub OIDC Authentication
- AWS WAF
- CloudFront Logging
- S3 Access Logging
- CloudWatch Monitoring
- Terraform Modules
- Multi-Environment Deployment (Dev/Stage/Prod)

---

## 🌐 Deployment Status

The infrastructure for this project has been successfully deployed and validated on AWS using Terraform.

To minimize AWS costs, the infrastructure may be destroyed when not actively being demonstrated. The repository includes architecture diagrams, deployment screenshots, and Infrastructure as Code to fully document the implementation.


# 💡 What I Learned

Building this project gave me hands-on experience with:

- Designing secure AWS architectures using Amazon S3 and CloudFront
- Implementing Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
- Managing remote Terraform state with Amazon S3 and DynamoDB
- Building CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions
- Troubleshooting real-world deployment issues
